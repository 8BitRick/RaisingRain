RaisingRain
===========

Rain that falls upward. Experimental drawing using canvas and CoffeeScript.

FiddleSalad link:

This is just some experimenting I am doing.
The only real files you need are
* index.html
* coffee-script.js

`fallingup03.js.coffee` contains just the CoffeeScript for the animation.

I am at the limit of what I will do with this experiment.
At this point I think it is wiser to switch to WebGL or continue this experiment in a game engine.

## To do
* ~~Put into 3D space~~ (done)
* Add camera
* Add perspective transform
* Add keys for movement of camera

## Next plans
* Add fading/bluring or other cool effects
* Move everything into shaders
