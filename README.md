RaisingRain
===========

Rain that falls upward. Experimental drawing using canvas and CoffeeScript.

This is just some experimenting I am doing.
The only real files you need are
* index.html
* coffee-script.js

`fallingup03.js.coffee` contains just the CoffeeScript for the animation.

All of the other files are just reference chunks code I'm messing with.

## To do
* Put into 3D space
* Add camera
* Add perspective transform
* Add keys for movement of camera

## Next plans
* Add fading/bluring or other cool effects
* Move everything into shaders
